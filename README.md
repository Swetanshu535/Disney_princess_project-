🚀 New Python Project Drop!

This time, I dived into the magical world of Disney with a data twist! 👑✨
Using Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, I explored and visualized a dataset of Disney Princesses. From identifying which film introduced the most princesses to visualizing royal status and features like hair and eye color — it was all about bringing data to life!

🔍 What I did:

Imported and cleaned an Excel dataset using Pandas 🧹

Used Seaborn to create beautiful bar charts, pie charts, and box plots 📊

Analyzed royal status, film frequency, and more

Learned to make my plots readable with rotations and layout control

📌 Key skills used:
pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, data storytelling
